Quick little script to generate the figures from a paper on a typology of unmarried cohabitation I'm coauthoring.

Data generation script has been added, you just have to supply your own Czech GGP datasets from https://www.ggp-i.org/ to get them to work. I'm still working on making them compatible with the figure script (originally I just had to import some horrendous excel files).
